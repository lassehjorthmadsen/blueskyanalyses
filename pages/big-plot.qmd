This is a 3d-visualization of a 20 percent random sample of the scientists' network on Bluesky. (We don't display the whole network because the visualization would be too heavy to render nicely.) The plot is interactive, you can pan, zoom, rotate, using mouse or touch screen. Hovering over any individual will show their Blue Sky description. Perhaps go full-screen with F11. Have fun.
