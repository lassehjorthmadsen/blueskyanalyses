    "title": "A Simple Algorithm to Build a Network from Bluesky",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is this?\nThis a description of an algorithm than can build a network of actors on Bluesky (or, in principle, other domains). It is what we currently use to identify the science and research network on Bluesky, which we then analyze to identify influential scientists and more.\n\n\nOverall idea\nBluesky is one big network with millions of actors (users) connected though billions of follows. The hypothesis is, that we can meaningfully identify subsets of this network that consists of actors that are similar in some sense. Like for example the science and research community that we mainly deal with here, but potentially also actors that share other interests (writing, art, sports, etc.) or some other commonality that connects them.\nTo illustrate, below is a random network between 20 actors, with a hypothetical sub-network of actors colored dark blue. How do we identify the dark blue actors in our subset, given that we don’t know beforehand if they really are dark or light blue?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort version\nOn a high level the algorithm works like this:\n\nFirst, hand-pick a single (or several) dark blue actor(s). This is basically actors that we assume must belong the to sub-network of interest, if it exists.\nThen, get a list of everyone that key actor (or actors) follows. By definition, this must include some of the other the dark blue actors in our subset, because connections are what define a network.\nNext, we identify prospects, i.e. potential additional network members. We do this by filtering out anyone followed who should not be part of the network. For inclusion, two criteria must be fulfilled:\n\nDescription field: Prospects must contain certain predefined keywords. In the case of the science/research community it could be words like “professor” or “biologist”.\nNumber of follows: Prospects must be followed by a certain proportion of the existing network, say, five percent. (In the first iteration everyone is followed by 100%, namely our one key actor, so everyone passes this criteria.)\n\nSuccessful prospects, i.e. those being followed who also pass the two criteria above, are now added to the network and we start over from from step 2 by fetching lists of everybody they follow.\nThe process is repeated until either no more new members are found, or we reach a maximum number of iterations (like 30).\n\nThe exclusion criteria under step 3. are necessary, because our sub-network also follows actors from outside the network (friends, families, media, celebrities, etc). If we don’t exclude those, the sub-network might not be too meaningful – and we might end up with the whole of Bluesky.\n\n\nMore detail\nTo get a better feel for how the algorithm works in practice, here’s some output from the first two iterations on an actual run:\n\n\nInitial network:\n   Number of actors     : 3\n   Number of follows    : 96\n   Number of connections: 96\n\nExpanding the network, iteration number: 1\n   Number of prospects meeting the followers threshold of 0.05: 96\n   Number of valid prospects also matching the provided keywords: 73\n   Getting follows  ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100% | ETA:  0s\n   Number of new actors with followers to add to network: 73\n\nUpdated network:\n   Number of actors     : 76\n   Number of follows    : 111714\n   Number of connections: 133645\n\nTime difference of 5.874215 mins\n\nExpanding the network, iteration number: 2\n   Number of prospects meeting the followers threshold of 0.05: 2311\n   Getting profiles ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100% |  ETA:  0s\n   Number of valid prospects also matching the provided keywords: 1789\n   Getting follows  ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■  100% | ETA:  0s\n   Number of new actors with followers to add to network: 1787\n\nUpdated network:\n   Number of actors     : 1863\n   Number of follows    : 307288\n   Number of connections: 1743799\n\nTime difference of 1.163442 hours\n\n\nLet’s walk through what happens.\nFirst few lines concern the initial, hand-pick network. In this case, it consists of three actors, that we assume must be part of the network of interest. They follow a total of 96 other actors. This initial network consists of 96 connections, so we know that each of the 96 is followed exactly once. In other words, so far there’s no overlap between who our three hand-picked actors follow.\nNext chunk of output shows how the network is expanded in the first iteration. Out of the 96 actors being followed, all of them passes the 0.05 threshold (meaning they must be followed by 5 percent). We knew this would be the case, because they are all being followed by one third on the network: One of the three original hand-picked members.\n73 of the 96 also matches the keywords we provided, so it looks like most have some affiliation with the network we’re trying to establish. Therefore, 73 new actors are added to the network. (The progress bar is because it can take some time to get all the follows, and it’s nice to know about how far we are.)\nFirst iteration took a bit less than 6 minutes, the output says.\nNext, we see that the updated network, now consists of 76 actors (the original 3 plus the added 73). Together, they are following a lot of potential new members: 111,714 in total. This time the number of connections is a bit higher than that, 133,645, so some must be followed by more than one.\nNow, next iteration: Of the 111,714 actors 2,311 meet the followers threshold, i.e. being followed by at least 5 percent of the 76 actors now in the network. We need their profiles to examine the descriptions; the progress bar indicates that this can take some time. Turns out 1,789 meet the keyword criteria. This time, slightly fewer, 1,787, are actually added to the network; a few are exclude because they don’t follow any, or because their profiles are private.\nNext chunk: The update network is now at 1,863 (76 + 1,787) who follows 307,288 actors altogether, with 1,743,799 connections in total.\nIt took a while, a bit over an hour, to collect profiles and follows for all those users. At some point the algorithm normally speeds up: This happens when we have found most users that match our criteria, and subsequent iterations find only a few extra.\nWhen the algorithm finally finds no more members (or reaches the maximum number of iterations we allow for) the network is iteratively trimmed down to exclude actors that met the threshold of followers when they where included at an earlier stage, but not longer do.\n\n\nFurther reading\nIf you want to dig deeper, you can examine the documentation for the R-package I wrote to implement this. Or, even deeper, the code itself on github. (This is also where to file bug reports.)\nIt is all still in active development, unstable, rough around the edges. So bear with us, and thank you for reading so far."

The goal is to better understand how this group of users interact on the platform.\nThe network is built using an iterative algorithm that works like this: We start off with a list of hand-picked members of the scientific community, then expand the network step-by-step. This takes place by considering potential new members that:\n\nare being followed by a substantial number from the existing network\nhave a bio description that indicates an affiliation with, or strong interest in, the scientific community\n\nAfter a number of iterations, we arrived at a science-oriented network of 39,030 members (or ‘actors’) on Bluesky. Many, but not all, do research at a research institution. A few are science writers, independent researchers, or work at private organisations.\nOnce the network is established, we can compute centrality measures, like betweenness centrality or PageRank to identify members that may be particularly influential.\nOver at the list of Influential Members of the Science Community, we have a table with the top-100 members of the network, ranked by centrality.

    "text": "What is this?\nThis is a review of the latest update of the Bluesky Science and Research Network. We compare the current network with the previous one: How many new network members did we get; how many did we lose; what are some characteristics of the newcomers?\n\n\nCounts\nThe current network, collected 2024-10-24, has 39030 members. The previous one, collected 2024-06-18, had 22255 members.\nThe net gain in members is thus 16775 which comes from 17393 newcomers minus 618 users that are no longer member of the research network.\nThe current net was was collected using a slightly different version of the algorithm, so it’s possible that some of the changes was because of that. Lost and gained members can also be due to some leaving or joining Bluesky, changes in descriptions, or in the connections between members.\n\n\nNewcomers\nFrom the profile information, we know when the profiles where created, so we can check if all or most the newcomers have been created after the first network was collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that a significant chunk of the newcomers where created recently (most in August 2024) so that accounts for some of the increase, although not the major part.\n\n\nKeywords\nWe added a bunch of new keywords, among other things to include the climate science field. Let’s check if that affected the number of members included in the science network.\n\nThe original keywords\nacademic, amanuensis, anthropologist, assistant, behavioral, biologist, biology, candidate, chemist, cognition, cognitive, computational, computing, doktorand, ecology, economy, education, engineer, english, ethicist, evolution, faculty, fellow, geoeconomics , geographer, geopolitics, historian, history, humanities, infectious , institute, law, learning, lecturer, linguist, michigan, neurologist, neuroscience, ph.d, phd, philosopher, philosophy, physicist, physics , policy, post-doc, postdoc, professor, psychology, research, scholar, school, science, scientist, student, studies, studying, teaching, universitet, university\nSome keywords in the above list, like “academic”, are rather generic. The list was generated based on a statistical analysis of what words scientists or researchers on Bluesky was likely to include in their description. For that reason words like “Michigan” also made it to the list – and might be removed again.\n\n\nThe added keywords\nadjunct professor, ai, art historian, artificial intelligence, behavioral economics, bioinformatics, biomedical, biotechnology, blockchain, cardiologist, chemical engineer, civil engineer, classics, climatologist, cognitive neuroscience, criminologist, cultural studies, cybersecurity, data scientist, dean, demographer, doctor, economist , electrical engineer, environmental engineer, epidemiologist, gender studies, geneticist, geologist, geophysicist, instructor, literary critic, machine learning, materials science, mechanical engineer, media studies, mentor, meteorologist, musicology, nanotechnology, neuroethics, oceanographer, oncologist, paleontologist, pharmacologist, philosophy of science, physician, political scientist, provost, psychiatrist, public health, quantum computing, religious studies, renewable energy, robotics, scicomm, science communication, social work, sociologist, surgeon, synthetic biology, theology, trainee, virologist\nNote that some of these are two-word phrases that really are redundant, since one is already included above. For example, “adjunct professor” is already covered by “professor”. It doesn’t harm, but for clarity and brievity we could clean this up a bit.\nCounting how many profiles matches the old and the new keywords (or both) we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatches old keyword\nMatches new keyword\nn\n\n\n\n\nFALSE\nFALSE\n6\n\n\nTRUE\nFALSE\n28534\n\n\nTRUE\nTRUE\n10490\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that no profiles has a description that matches the new keywords without also matching the old ones.\n\n\nExamples\nSpot-checking for descriptions that contain “climatologist” we can look at the following descriptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nthefosterlab.bsky.social\nPalaeoclimatologist and isotope geochemist at the University of Southampton.

Below, we plot the distribution of followers, in absolute numbers (left) and as a percentage of all network members (right). Both metrics are split by network: The smaller, older one and the newer, bigger one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe note that the distributions are highly right-skewed, with a few profiles having very many followers. Also, since we increased the inclusion threshold from 30 to 40, the previous network has few more profiles at the low end of the scale. But since the current network is bigger, it has more members with a low number of followers when expressed as a percentage.\nWe can look at some summary statistics to be more precise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork\nMetric\nMin.\n1st Qu.\nMedian\nMean\n3st Qu.\nMax.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower count\n39.00\n61.00\n99.00\n170.49\n188.00\n8281.00\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower percent\n0.10\n0.16\n0.25\n0.44\n0.48\n21.22\n\n\nPrevious\nFollower count\n30.00\n55.00\n92.00\n140.13\n162.00\n5158.00\n\n\nPrevious\nFollower percent\n0.13\n0.25\n0.41\n0.62\n0.72\n22.99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the median number of followers for members of the current is 99. Half has below that number of followers, the other half above.\nIt’s a little surprising that some members of the current network only has 39 followers, since we set the threshold at 40. It could be due to rare circumstances, when a member is included with 40 followers, but one of those followers is later excluded.\nIndeed, looking at the actual counts, 40+ is much more common than 39:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork\nMetric\nValue\nCount\n\n\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower count\n39\n4\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower count\n40\n534\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower count\n41\n573\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower count\n42\n595\n\n\nCurrent\nFollower count\n43\n530\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we’re at it, let’s check some of the extremely high values, to see if they are actually relevant network members (as opposed to some media or institutional profiles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle\nDescription\nFollowers count\nTotal followers\nPosts count\n\n\n\n\nedyong209.bsky.social\nWriter, journalist.

Note that we included also the total number of followers, i.e. from profiles outside the network, as well as the count of posts. We see that those popular profiles tend to be very active and also popular outside the network. Not surprisingly, there are quite a bit of journalists, writers, and speakers in this select group.\n\n\nCommunities\nFinally, let’s examine if the distribution of the communities changed. The “communities” are parts of the network that has a particular high density. They are detected using an algorithm, and they often align roughly with different academic fields.\nIt’s a little difficult to compare communities across networks, because the algorithm just assigns an arbitrary number to label profiles that are in the same community. A label of \\(3\\) in the previous network does not have anyting to do with a label of \\(3\\) in another network. But we can roughly map the two sets of communities: If profiles that used to be in community \\(3\\) are now mostly in community \\(7\\) we can assume they are similar (people don’t change academic fields that often).\nIn order to label the communities with something a little more descriptive, we take the top most frequent words from the profile description in each community. (To discount very frequent words, we use weighted frequencies, specifically “term frequency–inverse document frequency”).\nA plot of the distribution of communities in the previous and the current network:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all communities are bigger than before since the whole network has grown. We note that in particular the “law | science | policy” community has grown by a lot.\nTo finish off, below are samples of influential profiles from each of the communities. Recall that each profile does not necessarily has the words from the community label in its description; the labels describe the community as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle\nDescription\nCommunity label\nTotal followers\n\n\n\n\ndrtlovesbooks.bsky.social\nSchool Libraries are the cure for what ails education! | M.Ed., Ed.D., M.I. | 25 yr vet Tchr | he/him | Lots o' SLMS stuff @ http://SchoolLibLearning.net\nlibrarian | school | library\n1077\n\n\nreading2learn.bsky.social\nSchool Librarian-Wife-Mom-Educator-Tech-Books. #tlchat #digcit #mglit #futurereadylibs #istelibs #aasl #ncte #elachat #ELLs🌈ally #WeNeedDiverseBooks ☮️\nlibrarian | school | library\n487\n\n\nmstewartscience.bsky.social\nWrites science books for kids.
